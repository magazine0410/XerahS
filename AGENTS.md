# XerahS agent instructions

XerahS is the Avalonia implementation of ShareX.

## Repository invariants

- Preserve unrelated working-tree changes. Stay on the current branch; create branches only when explicitly requested.
- Keep `TreatWarningsAsErrors` enabled. Preserve each project's platform conditions: Windows-specific targets use `net10.0-windows10.0.26100.0`; cross-platform targets use `net10.0`.
- Keep `SkiaSharp` and all `SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.*` packages on the same version in root `Directory.Packages.props`. Use central package management; do not restore legacy project-local pins.
- In Windows PowerShell, use separate commands or `if ($?) { ... }` for conditional sequencing; do not use `&&`.

## ShareX parity

- When adding a feature that ShareX has and XerahS lacks, mirror ShareX's behavior wherever possible: defaults, options, wording, menu placement, and results. Confirm the behavior in the ShareX source (a local ShareX checkout, or https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX) instead of assuming it.
- Deviate only where ShareX's behavior cannot work in XerahS (for example, a Windows-only API on Linux), where it is a clear bug, or where the user decides otherwise. When a deviation is a choice rather than a necessity, ask the user. Report every deviation and its reason.
- Syncing the `ShareX.ImageEditor` submodule with upstream follows [.ai/skills/port-imageeditor/SKILL.md](.ai/skills/port-imageeditor/SKILL.md) instead.

## Git identity

Use your matching Git wrapper when available:

| Agent | Wrapper |
|---|---|
| Aoife | `git-aoife` |
| Mikhail | `git-mikhail` |
| Declan | `git-declan` |
| Vladislava | `git-vladislava` |

Before pushing, confirm identity and remote with `git-<person> whoami`. If your wrapper is unavailable, use configured Git after checking `user.name`, `user.email`, and `git remote -v`. Keep the configured identity and remotes unless asked to change them.

For commits, pushes, and version changes, use [.ai/skills/git-workflow/SKILL.md](.ai/skills/git-workflow/SKILL.md). XerahS commit prefixes must use the next unreleased app version; shared-library commits omit the app version.

## Scope and completion

- Continue authorized implementation through integration and relevant verification. Resolve routine local decisions; ask only for missing decisions that materially change the requested outcome or authority.
- Issue creation/updates require an explicit request. Publishing, releases, billing, production changes, secrets exposure, and irreversible user-data deletion require authorization covering that action.
- Before pushing code or build configuration, `dotnet build src/desktop/XerahS.sln` must pass with 0 errors, plus relevant tests. Documentation-only changes need diff, link, and instruction-consistency checks, not an application build. For a version-only root `Directory.Build.props` bump, verify the exact version diff and commit prefix.
- Complete the requested behavior, including affected callers and failure paths; report verification evidence and any remaining blocker. Do not stop at a draft when implementation was requested.
- Judge build progress from output and process activity, without a fixed time limit. Stop only confirmed stalled task processes; consult [.ai/skills/build-common/SKILL.md](.ai/skills/build-common/SKILL.md) for lock recovery.
- Load only matching workflows from `.ai/skills/` and the references needed for the task. Keep always-on policy here, compatibility files thin, and durable lessons in `developers/lessons-learnt/`.
